## 📝 Overview
FRONTEND-SSA is a React Native app for managing alerts, contacts, and user authentication. It is designed to be robust, scalable, and easy to extend, making it a perfect showcase for frontend development skills sought by top companies.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login, registration, and profile management.
- **Alert Management**: Create, view, update, and resolve alerts with a clean UI.
- **Contact Management**: Add, view, and delete contacts for quick access.
- **Navigation Stacks**: Modular navigation using stack/tab navigators for seamless UX.
- **Reusable Components**: Custom components like `AlertCard` and `TagButton` for DRY code.
- **Context API for State Management**: Centralized auth state using React Context.
- **API Integration**: Clean API layer for all backend communication, easily configurable.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first layouts and adaptive icons.
- **Error Handling & Feedback**: User-friendly error messages and alert feedback.
- **Code Modularity**: Well-organized folders for screens, components, contexts, and config.

---

## 🖥️ Screens & Components
- **Screens**:
  - Home, Explore, Alerts (All/Resolved), Alert Details
  - Login, Register, Settings, Contact
- **Components**:
  - `AlertCard`: Displays alert info with status and actions
  - `TagButton`: Reusable button for tags/filters
- **Navigation**:
  - `HomeStack`, `ExploreStack`, `TabStack` for scalable routing

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React Native** (core framework)
- **React Navigation** (multi-stack/tab navigation)
- **Context API** (state management)
- **Fetch API** (network requests)
- **Modular JS/ES6+** (modern JavaScript)

## ⚡ Setup & Running Locally
1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd FRONTEND-SSA
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
3. **Configure API:**
   - Edit `config/apiConfig.js` to set your backend URL if needed.
4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```
   - Use Expo Go or your preferred emulator/device to view the app.

## 🌟 Why This Project Stands Out
- **Advanced State Management**: Uses Context API for scalable, maintainable state.
- **API Abstraction**: All endpoints and API logic are modular and easily swappable.
- **Component Reusability**: Custom, parameterized components for DRY and testable code.
- **Navigation Architecture**: Multi-stack/tab navigation for real-world app complexity.
- **Clean Code & Structure**: Follows best practices for readability and maintainability.
- **UI/UX Focus**: Responsive layouts, adaptive icons, and user-centric feedback.
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new features, screens, or API endpoints.
